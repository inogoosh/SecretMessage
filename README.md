# SecretMessage-python
A Python script to encode and decode secret messages using basic encryption techniques.

# 🔐 Secret Message Encoder & Decoder (Python)
This is a simple Python project that lets you **encode** and **decode secret messages** using a randomly generated password. It's perfect for beginners who are learning about strings, loops, and basic encryption in Python.

# 🧠 How It Works
**Encoding**: Each character in your message is shifted by a random number (called password).
**Decoding**: The password is used to reverse the shift and reveal the original message.

# ✅ Features
- Encode any secret message
- Decode using the correct password
- Simple command-line interface (CLI)
- Beginner-friendly code

# 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python installed**.
2. Download or clone this repo.
3. Run the Python script:

# 🤺 How to Use
Write 1 for Encoding and 2 for Decoding the Message, else enter any other key to exit:

➤ To Encode:
Enter 1

Type your secret message

You'll get the encoded message and a password — share this password with the person you want to decode the message

➤ To Decode:
Enter 2

Paste the encoded message

Enter the correct password to see the original message

# 📝 Example
Write 1 for Encoding and 2 for Decoding the Message, else enter any other key to exit: 1

Enter your Secret message: hello

Encoded Message: æíññò

Your Password is: 250

Write 1 for Encoding and 2 for Decoding the Message, else enter any other key to exit: 2

Enter the Encoded text: æíññò

Enter the password: 250

Decoded Message: hello
